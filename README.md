## [Booga](https://github.com/RaunchySanta/Booga/) - Developed by [Raunchy Santa](https://github.com/RaunchySanta/)

I created Booga because I wanted to create my own survival experience. At first, I started with an idea, many in fact. I slowly changed a few things, allowing me to work within my limits. Even though what exists is within my limits, that doesn't mean I won't improve my limits, thus allowing me to revamp some things on Booga.

My original idea was to provide a survival experience where unsecure players could delay war and grief with a simple offering. By sacrificing what would be considered valuable, players would gain blessings (positive status effects) and protection from PvP and Grief. The general idea is that Booga is meant for small servers, usually servers that consist of close friends, or lets players.

Booga was originally designed for Spigot 1.12.2 in mind. It currently supports version 1.19.2. 

Other versions have not been tested. As long as the Spigot API hasn't changed much, it should be compatible with newer versions of Minecraft.

This mod is a VERY ROUGH DRAFT. It's not optimized, and the code is pretty crap. It's really just a prototype, and it works for me.

No matter what the project licensing says, I grant complete permission to do anything you see fit with it. You could even ~try~ to sell the base version of it, nothing's stopping you. 

I however am not liable for any warranties or damages caused by the use of the software The software is provided as-is.

For economy access, Booga requires [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/) and recommends [XConomy 2.53](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/xconomy.75669/).
